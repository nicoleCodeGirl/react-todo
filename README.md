This is my project for Code the Dream's React Class!


During class I will be building TWO React apps...

The FIRST will be a BLOG APP that I build while working through the class textbook. The blog app I will create completely from scratch following the book instructions. I should keep my work for the blog app in a separate repository.

The SECOND will be a TO-DO LIST APP that I will build as extra coding practice during my coding assignments throughout the class.
